# Helping the LGBTQIA+ Community Analyze Hate Crimes for #PrideMonth

Back in 2015, I worked with the IBM Watson Analytics team to promote the idea of the citizen analyst, the average citizen who could do data analysis in support of causes they care about. The concept was solid: given the right tools, people could help understaffed and underfunded causes make the most of data that was publicly available.

Unfortunately, this vision never came to fruition. Not because people don't care or the tools were bad, but because the data that most causes and organizations work with is incredibly messy. Messy, badly structured data is difficult to work with, and the average citizen analyst isn't going to have the time or the background to clean up the data in order to make use of it, even for causes that they're incredibly passionate about.

I recently took a look at one such data problem. As I write this, it's Pride Month, a celebration and recognition of the importance of equal rights for everyone, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. I had a data question I wanted an answer to, a puzzle to solve:

**How prevalent are hate crimes against LGBTQIA+ people in the United States?**

One would think, in this era of perpetual surveillance and instant communication, that this would be a simple, easily-obtained answer. Quite the contrary: in fact, the answer requires a lot of data detective work. However, if we do the preparatory work, the end result should be a dataset that any citizen analyst could pick up and use within everyday spreadsheet software to perform their own analysis.

Let's walk through the process, including some functional code you're welcome to copy and paste (or [grab the entire code/notebook from our Github repository](https://github.com/TrustInsights/fighting-lgbtqia-hatecrimes)) to find answers.
